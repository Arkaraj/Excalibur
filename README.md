## To Run it Locally

```sh
npm i
```

Add a secret.js file,

```js
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: " ",
  authDomain: " ",
  projectId: " ",
  storageBucket: " ",
  messagingSenderId: " ",
  appId: " ",
  measurementId: " ",
};
```

Create a secret.js file in root directory (.env is recommended), add the firebase configuration credentials there.
