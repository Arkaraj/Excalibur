ðŸš§ðŸš§ Work on Progress ðŸš§ðŸš§

## Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo CLI)
- Redux for State Management
- Firebase & FireStore for database and Storing images (or may just end up making a real server in NodeJS...)

npm i
```

Create a secret.js file in root directory (.env is recommended), add the firebase configuration credentials there.
